# React Redux Messenger

This is a code-along project that follows the [Free Code Camp Tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-redux-the-worlds-easiest-guide-to-beginning-redux-c695f45546f6) on learning Redux.  

This tutorial goes through a series of smaller examples and finally shows how to build this Mini Project. This tutorial took two days for me to complete as I was doing coding along. Through out this tutorial, the author teaches how to use pure redux without any middleware.  

To see this working for yourself, you just have to use two commands `npm install` or `yarn install` and `npm start` or `yarn start`.  

Thanks!
